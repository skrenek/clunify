# Clunify.
## Unifying Developer CLIs Since 2015

You're a developer.  You use lots of tools.  Some projects use grunt, some use gulp, some use others.  You switch back and forth between them a hundred times per day.  You switch terminals, run `gulp serve` and realize you're in a grunt project.  Argh!

Let's keep this simple.

1. Install this.  `npm install -g clunify`
2. Instead of using `gulp serve`, `grunt serve`, `ionic serve`, etc. in your projects, just use `clu serve` (or `clu whatever`).
3. Recover sanity.
4. Be happier.

clunify supports grunt, gulp, and ionic because I use them.
